## Project Goal
We delved into shopping behaviors using computer magic! Our mission was to discover fascinating insights about how people shop.

## How We Did It
1. 🧹 **Data Cleanup**: We tidied up the shopping data to make it crystal clear.
2. 🤝 **Grouping Similar Items**: We sorted things into groups to find similar stuff.
3. 📊 **Making Cool Pictures**: We made special charts to show how everything connects.
4. 🔍 **Finding Important Clues**: We discovered the key things that tell us a lot about shopping.

## What We Found
- 🌟 **Top Sellers**: Fresh products are the winners, followed closely by groceries.
- 👥 **Shopper Types**: We found 4 different kinds of shoppers using our special grouping method.
- 🧩 **Clearer Results**: Our method showed us clearer results compared to other ways.
- 📈 **Key Insights**: Just 3 important things tell us almost everything about shopping habits.

## Challenges Faced
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Data Cleanup Race**: We ran out of time to clean up all the tricky parts in the data.
- ⏰ **Time-Consuming Tasks**: Some functions took longer than expected, slowing down our progress.

## What's Next
1. 🧼 **Better Data Cleaning**: Improve our method to clean up data more efficiently.
2. 📊 **Performance Check**: Verify if our special grouping method is doing a great job.
3. 🔍 **Hunt for Key Factors**: Spend more time finding the top things that matter most for better shopping ideas!
