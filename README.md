## Project Goal🎯
I delved into shopping behaviors using computer magic! My mission was to discover fascinating insights about how people shop.

## Project Process⚙️
1. 🧹 **Data Cleanup**: I tidied up the shopping data to make it clear.
2. 🤝 **Grouping Similar Items**: I sorted things into groups to find similarities.
3. 📊 **Making Cool Pictures**: I made charts to show connections.
4. 🔍 **Finding Important Clues**: I tried to discover the key things about shopping.

## Project Results 📊
- 🌟 **Top Sellers**: Fresh products are the winners, followed closely by groceries.
- 👥 **Shopper Types**: I found different kinds of shoppers using our grouping method.
- 🧩 **Clearer Results**: Clear results were obtained.
- 📈 **Key Insights**: Generated key insights about shopping habits.


## Techniques Used🛠
1. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used various visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to understand data trends.
2. 📉 **Outlier Detection**: Employed techniques to identify and handle outliers in the dataset.
3. 🔄 **Data Transformation**: Performed necessary transformations on the data to make it suitable for analysis.
4. 🧮 **Feature Selection**: Picked important features to understand what matters most.
5. 📈 **Clustering Analysis**: Utilized KMeans and Hierarchical clustering techniques for segmenting similar products.

## Conclusions 📊
- Most customers spend moderately, but a few spend significantly more in each product category.
- Spending on groceries often correlates with spending on detergents_paper, while milk spending is related to grocery spending.
- Fresh product spending doesn't strongly relate to other categories, suggesting varied preferences.
- Many customers spend modestly, but some are occasional high spenders in specific categories.


## Challenges Faced🛠
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Data Cleanup Race**: I ran out of time to clean up all the tricky parts in the data.
- ⏰ **Time-Consuming Tasks**: Some functions took longer than expected, slowing down my progress.

## Future Considerations 🚀
1. 🧼 **Better Data Cleaning**: I plan to improve my method to clean up data more efficiently.
2. 📊 **Performance Check**: Verifying if my grouping method is doing a great job.
3. 🔍 **Hunt for Key Factors**: I aim to spend more time finding the top things that matter most for better shopping ideas!
